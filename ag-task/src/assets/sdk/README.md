<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="maps.css"/>
        <script src="maps.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
        <div id="map" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"></div>
        <script>
            const map = tt.map({
                key: "${api.key}",
                container: "map"
            });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
